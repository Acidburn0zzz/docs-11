# Building extensions for Contao 4

Building extensions for Contao 4 is (currently) still very similar to Contao 3.
The fundamentals like DCA, language files and templates are still in place and best practice,
but we will slowly migrate to use more and more Symfony components.

In this book, we will cover several chapters on how to prepare your Contao 3 extensions to
be compatible with Contao 4, or how to migrate them to a Symfony bundle.

> #### info:: Info  
> This book is intended as a to guide for developers familiar with Contao 3.
> If you are new to Contao, you should read the manual or cookbook first (see https://docs.contao.org/).
