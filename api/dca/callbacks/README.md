# Contao callbacks

Callbacks are entry-points for custom code in the DCA. Using callbacks you
can modify static Data Container Array during runtime.

Callbacks are very similar to [Hooks][hooks], but always bound to a specific DCA table
and can have a different registration scheme (e.g. they only support one
callback function).
