# Customizing Contao

Customizability is one of the most important features of any application and
particularly Content Management Systems. Contao provides many options to adjust
the configuration, customize fields and labels, add own code snippets or even
create new extensions. You can control almost any behaviour of the Contao core
without even touching its files, so you do not have to reapply your changes
after every update.
