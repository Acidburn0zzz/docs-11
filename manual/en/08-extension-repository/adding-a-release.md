## Adding a release

After you have created the extension, you can add a first release. Every new
version of the extension will be stored as separate release. Open the release
manager with the respective navigation icon and click the "Add release" button.

Version numbers in the Extension Repository consist of three numeric blocks that
indicate the major, minor and maintenance version (e.g. `1.0.0`) as well as a
textual development status (e.g. `beta1`).
