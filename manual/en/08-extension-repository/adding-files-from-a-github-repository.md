## Adding files from a GitHub repository

The files can also be imported from a GitHub repository, if you have tagged the
release and pushed the tag to the central GitHub repository.

Enter the HTTPS URL of the GitHub repository in the settings.

You can also specify the root folder name of your repository. In this case, the
files and folders outside of this root folder will be ignored during
the import.

If you select a tag, its files will be downloaded automatically and are then
available just like after a manual upload.
