## Publishing an extension

After you have created at least one release, uploaded at least one file,
published at least one translation and added the necessary dependencies, you can
publish the extension with the respective navigation icon. Note that you cannot
remove the extension anymore once it has been published. To check if everything
works as expected, log into the back end and make a test installation with the
extension manager.
