# Contao Documentation

We are maintaining the Contao documentation here. Each project has its own
subdirectory and can have multiple translations and versions (branches). If you
want to contribute to a particular project, please read the `README.md` file in
the corresponding subdirectory.


## API

the [api documentation on docs.contao.org][3]).


## Cookbook

Practical information and tips (see the [cookbook on docs.contao.org][1]).


## Manual

Official manual for users and developers (see the [manual on docs.contao.org][2]).


## Playground

Space for testing new projects.
